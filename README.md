# Assembly-8051
This is code for Lab Project two for ECEN332-UNO/UNL. This is for the 8051 legacy MCU and simulated/tested on DS89C450 with OPTREX Dot Matrix LCD. The task for 2.2 was to convert a string interpreted as a decimal value to a binary coded decimal. There are two versions of the 2.2. One that includes the assignment as intended and another that includes an interpretation where the string can be any ASCII character and converts the ASCII value by first taking the hexadecimal value and changing it to decimal. This was a more difficult task than the assignment intended so the code is left to be reviewed.
